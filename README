## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

Mainly when I was working with this project I realised how extraordinary the grid property was I was able to manipulate the two sections horizontally in desktop view and vertically in mobile view.

But I do want to learn more about image and background-image that how to properly cover the whole image inside the element.

### Continued development

I want to focus more on "grid" and "flex" property. And also the background image property.
